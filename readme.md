## Why not C?
Because I've already done C++ and the change between C++ and C would be minimal with the exception of the std::vector related items changed with a doubly-linked list. Plus if I did C I could only support a single data-type and it'd not be worth it really for me anyways.

## Why Lua then?
It's a simple language that's only got Hashtables("table" data type) so there's not even classes. So this would make this language make even less sense than C as you can't easily program in OOP at all without the use of metatables. So it's an interesing romp.
